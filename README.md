# Workflow-release-template

This template contains boilerplate code for the gradle release. The Gradle release workflow under GitHub Actions would 
quickly create a new release.

Anyone with access to the template repository can create a new repository based on the template 
with the same directory structure, branches, and files.

# How to use template repository

After you make your repository a template, anyone with access to the repository can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as your default branch.
